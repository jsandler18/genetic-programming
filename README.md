# genetic-programming
Me messing around with genetic programming in lisp.
I am essentially trying to recreate the genetic programming kernel from John Koza's book on genetic programming
without copying his code straight up.  I am trying to create it from the conceptual information alone to gain
a better understanding of genetic programming and machine learning in general
